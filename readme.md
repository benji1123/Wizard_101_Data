Here's the Plan, Ben...

1) create the HTML layout for the app
-fully text based (no pictures)
-create a button-set for each group (attack cards, blades, shields)


2) allow the app to retain what you press JS 
-allow users to temporarily store data before pushing it to the database
-allow users to edit temporarily stored data 


3) style the app


4) make use of the data
-create visualizations of the data (somehow)
